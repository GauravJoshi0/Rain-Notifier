# Rain-Notifier
This project is a Python script that fetches real-time weather data from the AccuWeather API and sends SMS alerts using Twilio. It checks for specific weather conditions (like rain or thunderstorms) and sends a notification if detected.

Here are the screenshots of the code and the output:
